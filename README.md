## [Android Malware Genome Project](http://www.malgenomeproject.org/)

In this project, we focus on the Android platform and aim to systematize or characterize existing Android malware. Particularly, with more than one year effort, we have managed to collect more than 1,200 malware samples that cover the majority of existing Android malware families, ranging from their debut in August 2010 to recent ones in October 2011.

## [ The Drebin Dataset ](https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/)

The dataset contains 5,560 applications from 179 different malware families. The samples have been collected in the period of August 2010 to October 2012 and were made available to us by the MobileSandbox project. You can find more details on the dataset in the [paper](http://filepool.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/publication/sec//2014-ndss.pdf).

## [AndroMalShare](http://sanddroid.xjtu.edu.cn:8080/#home)

AndroMalShare is a project focused on sharing Android malware samples. It's only for research, no commercial use. We present statistical information of the samples, a detail report of each malware sample scanned by [SandDroid](http://sanddroid.xjtu.edu.cn) and the detection results by the anti-virus productions. You can upload malware samples to share with others and each malware sample can be downloaded(only by registered users)!

## [Kharon Malware Dataset](http://kharon.gforge.inria.fr/dataset/)

The Kharon dataset is a collection of malware totally reversed and documented. This dataset has been constructed to help us to evaluate our research experiments. Its construction has required a huge amount of work to understand the malicous code, trigger it and then construct the documentation. This dataset is now available for research purpose, we hope it will help you to lead your own experiments.

## [AMD Project](http://amd.arguslab.org)

AMD contains 24,553 samples, categorized in 135 varieties among 71 malware families ranging from 2010 to 2016. The dataset provides an up-to-date picture of the current landscape of Android malware, and is publicly shared with the community.

## [Android PRAGuard Dataset](http://pralab.diee.unica.it/en/AndroidPRAGuardDataset)

As retrieving malware for research purposes is a difficult task, we decided to release our dataset of obfuscated malware.

The dataset contains 10479 samples, obtained by obfuscating the MalGenome and the Contagio Minidump datasets with seven different obfuscation techniques.

## [AndroZoo](https://androzoo.uni.lu/)

AndroZoo is a growing collection of Android Applications collected from several sources, including the official Google Play app market.It currently contains 5,781,781 different APKs, each of which has been (or will soon be) analysed by tens of different AntiVirus products to know which applications are detected as Malware.
We provide this dataset to contribute to ongoing research efforts, as well as to enable new potential research topics on Android Apps.By releasing our dataset to the research community, we also aim at encouraging our fellow researchers to engage in reproducible experiments.
